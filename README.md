# Applied Engineering - Full Stack Sandbox

A living workspace for experimenting with modern full-stack development patterns, 
technologies, and architectures. Projects are added progressively.

## Project Structure

Each folder represents a standalone experiment or feature exploration:

```
applied_engineering/
├── LaundryAPP/              # Backend service experiments
├── serverless_function/     # Firebase serverless tryouts
├── serverless_function2/    # Supabase serverless tryouts
├── walletConnect/           # Web3 frontend experiments
├── [future projects]/       # Coming soon...
```

## Current Focus Areas

- **Backend:** REST APIs, database design, business logic
- **Serverless:** Function-driven architecture, cloud deployments
- **Frontend:** React, modern UI frameworks, Web3 integration
- **Web3:** Wallet connections, blockchain interactions
- **DevOps:** Deployment patterns, CI/CD workflows

## Project Template

Each new project typically follows:
- **Package management:** npm/yarn
- **Language:** TypeScript (preferred) or JavaScript
- **Development:** Local dev environments with hot-reload
- **Build:** Production-ready bundling/deployment

## 🛠 Tech Stack (Evolving)

**Commonly Used:**
- Node.js + Express
- TypeScript
- React + Vite
- Firebase & Supabase
- SQLite / PostgreSQL
- Wagmi + Viem (Web3)

## How to Use This Workspace

1. **Explore a project:**
   ```bash
   cd <project-folder>
   npm install
   npm run dev  # or relevant command
   ```

2. **Add a new experiment:**
   - Create a new folder in `applied_engineering/`
   - Add its own `package.json`
   - Document purpose in this README

3. **Reference structure:**
   - Check existing projects for patterns
   - Reuse configurations as templates

## Active Experiments

Run `ls` or check folders for current projects.

##  Workflow

- Experiment → Learn → Iterate
- Projects are independent and can share learnings
- Stable patterns get reused; unsuccessful patterns inform future choices

##  Notes

- Each project is self-contained
- No shared dependencies between folders
- Use for rapid prototyping and learning
- Production-ready code = best practices applied
